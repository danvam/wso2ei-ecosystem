#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

filebeat.inputs:

# Each – is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

### Multiline options

# Multiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
# for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation

# The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
#multiline.pattern: ^\[
multiline.pattern: '^[[:space:]]+|^Caused by:|^[a-z]+.'

# Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
multiline.negate: false

# Match can be set to “after” or “before”. It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
# that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
# Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
multiline.match: after
